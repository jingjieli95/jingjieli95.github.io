### Research Overview

Successful attacks on “static” biometrics such as fingerprints have been reported where an adversary acquires users’ biometrics stealthily and compromises non-resilient biometrics. To mitigate the vulnerabilities of static biometrics, we leverage the unique and nonlinear hand-surface vibration response and design a system called Velody. Velody relies on two major properties in hand-surface vibration responses: uniqueness of human hands, and nonlinearity, preventing attackers from predicting an unseen response. Velody employs a challenge-response protocol with low-effort enrollment and authentication, stopping both replay and synthesis attacks.

We build a prototype to verify its usability and security. Our results show that Velody demonstrates both strong security and long-term consistency with a low equal error rate (EER) of 5.8% against impersonation attack while correctly rejecting all other attacks.
