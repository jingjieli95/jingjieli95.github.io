<p>Hey, thanks for stopping by Jingjie (a.k.a JJ)'s tiny place on the Internet. I am currently a Ph.D. student in computer engineering at the University of Wisconsin&#8212Madison. I am advised by Prof. Younghyun Kim at the <a href="https://wisest.ece.wisc.edu/">WISEST Lab</a> and work actively with the Wi-Pi Lab, where you can find a more "serious" copy of mine :). <br><br>

My research focus is human-centered computing. I design usable, sustainable, and privacy-aware interfaces for smart device users. I started my exploration from the field of personality computing during my bachelor study in Australia. Now in Madison, I have been working on a series of projects including user authentication, user privacy in interactive systems, and privacy notification. I also work with brilliant folks here to design power-efficient human-centered systems. <br><br>

I enjoy building these tangible gadgets that would potentially make our lives better and more fun, even by just a little bit, to exhaust the daydreams hoarded up during the Wisconsin winter.  

<!-- <p>Hey ya<br>My name is &lt;your name here&gt;, and I am a &lt;designation&gt; at &lt;university name&gt;. You can add more details here, such as the most recent affiliation to a research group, etc.<br><br>

I maintain a list of my publications, research projects and implementations under the <a href="/research/">Research</a> tab, and a list of other non-research projects under the <a href="/projects">Projects</a> tab. You may also check out my <a href="">Github profile.</a><br><br>

To get a better insight on my life so far, you can have a look at my <a href="/cv">curriculum vitae</a>. I blog (although quite less frequently) and pin them down <a href="/blog">here</a>. Feel free to read a bit more <a href="/about">about me</a>.</p> -->
